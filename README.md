This repo is for containers I have created which have no other clear location to be checked in.
Primarily these are containers I use for organizational purposes, to avoid installing bunches of
dependencies in my primary system.

The bin directory includes the simple scripts I use to run these after they are created.

More information is found in this [blog post](http://backgroundprocess.com/systems/desktop_docker/).
